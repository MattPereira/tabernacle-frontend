        <h4>Founding</h4>
        <p className="lead">
          1n 1989 our Founder, Margaret Bridges, felt Godâ€™s calling to establish
          Christian Schools in parts of the world that were previously
          unreachable. Tabernacle School has partnered with several schools
          overseas to help spread the good news of Jesus, and we continue to
          identify opportunities to impact our world.
        </p>
        <h4 className="">Restructuring</h4>
        <p className="lead">
          The school and church separated operations in 1996 and have continued
          to share our use of the Tabernacle Church property. At the beginning
          of the 2009 school year Mrs. Bridges retired from daily school
          services. We are grateful for the impact she has made as the Founder
          of Tabernacle School and we continue to honor her vision and her love
          for children. A management team was formed to oversee the day-to-day
          operations of the school, while our school board continues to be
          responsible for the vision, mission and finances of the school.
        </p>
        <h4 className="">Present Day</h4>
        <p className="lead">
          Tabernacle School has flourished under our current leadership team. We
          are continuing to look for ways to improve our campus through the use
          of technology and the integration of teaching methods based on our
          philosophy of multiple intelligences. Each year we strive for
          excellence in education while fostering a loving family atmosphere
          where children grow and thrive.
